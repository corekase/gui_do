This is a reusable gui for pygame programs.

gui_do is copyright Â© John Pickett.  Attribution may be made to either that name and/or corekase.

In the spirit of the license this code is offered under you have certain rights.  You have the right to use this library for any purpose you choose, even commercially, without cost and without having to share your own source code.  It's a library, to use as you need.  But, if you improve or change the gui_do library code then you must release just those improvements or changes publicly to anyone who asks under the same license as gui_do.  For all the work I've done in giving you this library, if you improve it, and just it, then share that back for the benefit of everyone.  Commercially even though, have fun.

Both the library source code and the examples are well-commented, reading them should give you a clear understanding of how to use the library in practice.  Documentation will eventually be made once the gui api and completion state stabilizes.

In the folder: /gui/extra is a file called "gui_do_template.py".  That file is boiler-plate, it's all the setup code needed to get going.  Whenever you begin a new program, copy that template and use it as a starting point.

The only required dependency for gui_do is pygame.
